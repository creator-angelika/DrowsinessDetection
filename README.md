# DrowsinessDetection



This project was developed using Python and AI to accurately detect and identify drowsiness symptoms through the user's webcam. I've implemented advanced algorithms to ensure precise detection of signs of drowsiness or sleeping on an individual's face. Creating this project has not only taught me how to build AI projects but has also inspired me to pursue more sophisticated projects in the future.
